## Development

### Install

`npm install`

You're also going to need pugjs and sass to compile the views and assets for electron.
I want to change that, but that's where we are right now.

### Run

`npm start`

### Build

`npm run build`

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).

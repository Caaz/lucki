> A music player by developers for developers.

Lucki Media Player is a simple media player. It makes no attempts to be the best, only the most flexible.

## Development
If you're planning on developing Lucki, make sure you're on the development branch! I try to make the master branch official stable releases. "Stable" should be taken with a grain of salt.
Try to keep to the xo rules defined in the [package.json](package.json)

### Install
`npm install`

### Run
`npm start`

### Build
`npm run build`

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
